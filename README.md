Submission for MLDA Hackathon 2024

## 📙 Overview

This project focuses on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) for HIV patients in developing countries. 

The goal is to enhance healthcare outcomes by improving treatment strategies and resource allocation, aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals objective of achieving Good Health & Well-Being.

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Achieving GOOD HEALTH & WELL-BEING in the World!**  
Develop and implement a Reinforcement Learning-based approach to optimize treatment regimens for HIV patients in developing countries, ensuring that healthcare resources are used efficiently and effectively.

## ❗ Objectives

- **Optimize DTRs**: Use RL to identify the most effective treatment strategies for HIV patients.
- **Improve Healthcare Delivery**: Enhance the allocation of healthcare resources and treatments.
- **Support Developing Countries**: Tailor solutions to address specific healthcare challenges faced by developing nations.

## 💯 Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Model**: Implemented RL algorithms to learn and optimize treatment strategies.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed patient data to inform RL models and improve treatment outcomes.
- **Simulation Environment**: Created a simulation environment to test and validate treatment strategies.
